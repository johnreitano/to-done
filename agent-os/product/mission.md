## The Problem

### Task Management Tools Are Either Too Simple or Too Complex
Most free task managers lack essential features like rich formatting, sharing, and deadlines, forcing users to upgrade prematurely. Enterprise solutions are overkill and expensive for individuals and small teams. Users need a middle ground that provides robust core features for free while offering premium capabilities for those who need them.

**Our Solution:** To-Done provides a complete task management experience in the free tier with all essential features, while reserving advanced collaboration, automation, and AI assistance for the paid tier. This allows users to be productive immediately and upgrade only when they need enhanced capabilities.

### Collaboration Requires Awkward Workarounds
Sharing individual tasks via links is helpful, but true collaboration requires shared lists where multiple people can add, edit, and track tasks together. Most free tools don't support this, fragmenting team workflows.

**Our Solution:** Free users can share individual tasks with rich OpenGraph previews, while paid users get full shared list capabilities with assignees and team visibility, enabling seamless collaboration without forcing everyone onto a paid plan.

### Context Switching Wastes Time
Users constantly switch between viewing modes depending on whether they need a quick overview (list) or detailed information (cards). Tools that lock users into one view reduce productivity.

**Our Solution:** To-Done offers instant switching between list and card views, letting users choose the right perspective for their current context without losing information or reorganizing their tasks.

## Differentiators

### Freemium That Doesn't Feel Crippled
Unlike competitors like Todoist or Asana that gate basic features behind paywalls, To-Done's free tier includes rich text descriptions, deadlines, assignees, multiple view modes, and individual task sharing. Users get a complete experience, not a trial.
This results in higher user satisfaction, word-of-mouth growth, and natural upgrades when users genuinely need advanced features.

### AI That Augments Rather Than Replaces
Our AI assistance (paid tier) helps break down complex tasks, suggests deadlines, and drafts descriptions - but keeps the user in control. Unlike tools that try to fully automate task management, we enhance human decision-making.
This results in faster task creation without sacrificing user agency or creating AI dependency for basic operations.

### Share Without Forcing Sign-Ups
Free users can share individual tasks via links with rich OpenGraph previews, allowing recipients to see task details without creating an account. Paid users get full collaborative shared lists.
This results in lower friction for casual collaboration and a clear value proposition for teams that need deeper integration.
