## Version Control Standards

### Commit Messages

#### Core Standards

- **Summarize what changed**: Provide a clear, concise description of the current changes in the staged and unstaged changes
- **Single line only**: No multi-line messages
- **Format**: `<brief description>` (no prefixes, no special formatting)
- **Length**: Short and concise
- **No conventional commit types**: Do NOT use feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.
- **No co-authors**: NEVER include Co-Authored-By lines
- **No attribution**: Do NOT include links or attribution text
- **Focus**: Describe what changed, not why

#### Examples of Good Commit Messages

- "Add expand editor modal for Code Embed section"
- "Update user profile validation logic"
- "Fix navigation menu alignment on mobile"
- "Remove deprecated authentication middleware"
- "Add Next.js web app to Docker Compose with hot reload"

#### Examples of Bad Commit Messages (DO NOT USE)

❌ "feat: Add new feature"
❌ "Fix bug in authentication"
❌ "Update code\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude"
❌ "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]"
❌ "WIP: working on feature"

#### Output Format

Provide ONLY the commit message text, nothing else:

```
Your single-line commit message here
```

#### Guidelines

- Read the diff carefully to understand all changes
- If multiple unrelated changes, note that (but still generate one message)
- Use active voice: "Add", "Update", "Fix", "Remove", "Refactor"
- Be specific but concise
- Avoid vague terms like "various changes" or "improvements"
- Focus on user-facing impact when applicable
- Keep length to under 70 characters if possible

### Pull Requests


#### Core Description Standards

- **Format**: Comprehensive markdown description
- **Purpose**: Explain changes, their purpose, and relevant context
- **Attribution**: To the current git user (no AI attribution)


#### Core Title Standards 

- **Title content**: Summarize the description in one line under 60 characters
- **Title format**: `[<ticket-id>] Ticket Title` (handled separately)

- Include specific file paths when referencing changes
- Mention any new dependencies or configuration changes
- If changes affect documentation, mention which docs were updated

#### Examples of Good Descriptions
