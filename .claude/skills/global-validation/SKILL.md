name: Global Validation
description: Implement input validation using Zod schemas for API routes and React Hook Form, with Supabase Row-Level Security for database-level enforcement. Use this skill when creating Zod schemas for API input validation, when using zodResolver with React Hook Form, when implementing server-side validation in API routes, when writing Supabase RLS policies, when returning field-level validation errors, when sanitizing user input, when validating request bodies with safeParse, or when implementing client-side form validation.
