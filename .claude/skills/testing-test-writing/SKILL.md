name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write tests using Jest and React Testing Library focusing on core user flows, behavior testing, and proper mocking of Supabase, Stripe, and OpenAI. Use this skill when creating test files with .test.ts or .test.tsx extensions, when using render screen and userEvent from Testing Library, when mocking Supabase client for database operations, when testing React components with user interactions, when writing API route tests, when mocking Stripe or OpenAI for integration tests, when using jest.fn() for mock functions, or when deciding what to test vs skip during feature development.

## When to use this skill

- When creating `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` files
- When using `render`, `screen`, `userEvent` from React Testing Library
- When mocking Supabase client with `jest.mock('@/lib/supabase/server')`
- When testing React components with user interactions
- When writing tests for API routes (`route.test.ts`)
- When mocking Stripe or OpenAI for integration tests
- When using `jest.fn()` for mock functions
- When deciding what to test vs skip during feature development
- When writing descriptive test names with `it('displays error when...')`
