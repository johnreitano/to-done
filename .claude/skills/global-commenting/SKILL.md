description: Write minimal, meaningful code comments that explain complex logic and non-obvious decisions while prioritizing self-documenting code. Use this skill when deciding whether to add a comment, when explaining complex business logic, when documenting non-obvious workarounds, when removing outdated or redundant comments, when refactoring to make code self-documenting, when adding JSDoc to exported functions, or when reviewing code for unnecessary comments.
